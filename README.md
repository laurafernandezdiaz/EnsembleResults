# HPO with Ensembles

To execute use the run_Method scripts that are in the code folder.

To run it directly without the script, you have to create the `code/Method/exp/` structure, for example: `code/GridSearch/1/`.

For ensemble methods use `code/Method/Ensemble/exp`, for example `code/CombineGS/RBST_ICM/1/`.
